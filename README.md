### Accessing Raw Text

## Self-Hosting

DropCloud is open-source, allowing you to host it yourself. Simply download the source code and run `main.py`. You'll need Python installed along with Flask.



### Important Note
We do not recommend making your self-hosted DropCloud instance public as it could be a target for hacking, DDoS attacks, or information theft.

### API

The API is also very easy to use.

#### Get Raw Text From ID (No Password)
```python
import requests

# URL of the website displaying raw text
url = 'https://direct-jania-dropcloud-aaabff56.koyeb.app/{YOUR_ID}/raw'  # Replace with the actual URL of your paste file

# Send a GET request to the URL
response = requests.get(url)

# Check if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Print the text content of the response
    print(response.text)
else:
    print(f"Failed to retrieve content. Status code: {response.status_code}")
```
This example will go to your paste and take the raw text if you need to get text from a paste then you will have to use raw unless you want to use a web scraper which is just unnecessary.

#### Get Raw Text From ID (Password)
```python
import requests

# URL of the website displaying raw text
url = 'https://direct-jania-dropcloud-aaabff56.koyeb.app/{YOUR_ID}/raw?Password={YOUR PASSWORD}'  # Replace with the actual URL of your paste file

# Send a GET request to the URL
response = requests.get(url)

# Check if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Print the text content of the response
    print(response.text)
else:
    print(f"Failed to retrieve content. Status code: {response.status_code}")
```
This example does the same as the last example but instead puts in a password.

#### Submit paste to DropCloud (No Password)
```python
import requests

url = 'http://127.0.0.1:5000//SubmitP'
data = {
    "value_box": "{YOUR PASTE HERE}",
    "password": "{YOUR PASSWORD HERE}"
}
headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}

response = requests.post(url, json=data, headers=headers)

print(response.json())
```
#### Submit paste to DropCloud (Password)
```python
import requests

url = 'http://127.0.0.1:5000//Submit'
data = {
    "value_box": "{YOUR PASTE HERE}",
}
headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}

response = requests.post(url, json=data, headers=headers)

print(response.json())
```
Pretty Simple to use the Api as thats all you need to do to use full functionality of the website thru python.
